# OLED Display Using Raspberry Pi Pico and SPI


## OLED Display


## Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface with an OLED display using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board and the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol. The OLED display is a small, monochrome display capable of showing graphics and text.

This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the hardware, installing necessary libraries, and running the example code to display text and images on the OLED screen.

## Hardware Requirements
To complete this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Raspberry Pi Pico board
- OLED display with SPI interface
- Jumper wires
- Power source (USB cable or batteries)
- Software Requirements

## You will need the following software tools and libraries:

- MicroPython firmware for Raspberry Pi Pico
- Thonny or another MicroPython IDE
- ssd1306 MicroPython library (for the OLED display)

## Hardware Setup
Connect Raspberry Pi Pico and OLED Display:

Connect the SPI pins (SCK, MOSI) from the Raspberry Pi Pico to the corresponding pins on the OLED display.
Connect the CS (Chip Select), DC (Data/Command), and RES (Reset) pins from the Raspberry Pi Pico to the corresponding pins on the OLED display.
Connect power (3.3V) and ground (GND) from the Raspberry Pi Pico to the OLED display.
Note: Ensure that the connections are secure and match the pin assignments in your code.

Power Supply:

Power the Raspberry Pi Pico using a USB cable or batteries.
Ensure the OLED display is receiving power within its specified voltage range.
Software Setup
Install MicroPython:

If you haven't already, flash the MicroPython firmware onto your Raspberry Pi Pico. Follow the official Raspberry Pi Pico documentation for detailed instructions.
Install Required Libraries:

Make sure you have the ssd1306 MicroPython library installed on your Raspberry Pi Pico. You can install it using the MicroPython package manager (upip) or manually by copying the library files to the Pico.
Running the Example
Upload the Code:

Use Thonny or your preferred MicroPython IDE to upload the provided example code to your Raspberry Pi Pico.
Run the Code:

Execute the uploaded code on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
View the OLED Display:

Your OLED display should now display text and images according to the example code.

## Customizing the Display
You can customize the content displayed on the OLED screen by modifying the example code. The provided code demonstrates basic text and image display. Refer to the ssd1306 library documentation for advanced usage and customization options.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the OLED display not working as expected, refer to the Troubleshooting section in the README for guidance on identifying and resolving common problems.
